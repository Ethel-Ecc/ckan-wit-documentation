Installation
=============
CKAN-WIT is a metadata library for opendata portal. It is recommended as itâ€™s a higher-level tool that simplifies metadata aggregation for common use cases across
CKAN-compatible opendata portals.
This installation process applies to the proof-of-concept for which the library is being built and therefore sticks to some pythonic environment settings to show how it can be
installed and used.
