EO is responsible for the direction and form of this library, as well as its presentation.

Core Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Keep it simple, because, simplicity is always better than functionality.
The API has a higher priority. Everything else is secondary.
Strive to fit the 90% use-case threshold, and then ignore the nay-sayers.
