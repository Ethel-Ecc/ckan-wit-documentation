General Guidelines
------------------

Be Cordial
~~~~~~~~~~

    **Be cordial or be on your way**.

The golden rule that governs all forms of contribution to CKAN-WIT, including bug reporting, feature request, faqs, etc. is to
"be cordial or be on your way". **All contributions are welcome**, as long as everyone involved is treated with respect.

Get Early Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are contributing, do not feel the need to sit on your contribution until it is perfectly polished and complete. It helps everyone involved for you to seek feedback as early as you possibly can. Submitting an early, unfinished version of your contribution for feedback in no way prejudices your chances of getting that contribution accepted, and can save you from putting a lot of work into a contribution that is not suitable for the project.

Contribution Suitability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All contributions will be considered carefully, but from time to time, contributions will be rejected because they do not suit the
current goals or needs of the project.

If your contribution is rejected, don't despair! As long as you followed these guidelines, you will have a much better chance of getting your next contribution accepted.
